# redditbot
@roastmebot is a Slack bot that scrapes the top 1500 comments from the popular Roast Me subreddit (https://reddit.com/r/roastme) and will print one at random whenever a user in the same channel the bot is in types "roast me" or the bot's name.

The bot also uses Markov Chains to generate its own unique roasts, which turned out to be quite bold. Due to the NSFW nature of many of the comments on the subreddit (mainly due to topic), the bot is decidedly not PC. Additionally, we performed sentiment analysis on the reddit comments as well as the generated roasts. Analysis of the results can be found at http://plsroast.me.
